# CT-BE-DMS-DDD

In Week 1 of the Document Management System (DMS) project, we laid the groundwork for a secure and functional document management platform, using a monolithic architecture to streamline development and maintainability at this early stage. The primary goal for this week was to implement basic CRUD operations, allowing for document creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, along with the ability to upload documents with associated metadata. This metadata management was crucial, as we aimed to allow updates to document attributes without requiring re-uploads, which enhances the flexibility and efficiency of our system.

We prioritized security and user access control by implementing JWT-based authentication, ensuring only authorized users can access protected endpoints. This approach is reinforced by role-based access control (RBAC), allowing us to differentiate permissions between Admin and User roles. We also created endpoints for managing permissions and generating short-lived download links for document files, providing controlled, time-limited access to documents as an added layer of security.

Another focus was on making our document search functionality robust and versatile. We designed advanced search filters, enabling users to search based on tags and specific metadata. This adds significant utility to the DMS by allowing users to quickly locate documents based on relevant criteria.

From a technical perspective, we followed best practices to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase. As recommended, we used async-await for all asynchronous operations, enhancing code readability and minimizing callback complexities. We opted for Drizzle ORM to handle database interactions, integrating seamlessly with our chosen database to simplify CRUD operations. Furthermore, instead of relying on database-generated IDs, we generated UUIDs at the application level to ensure unique and consistent identifiers for documents across the system.

To ensure data integrity and prevent errors, we validated all inputs using Zod. This ensured that every request to our endpoints met expected data requirements, particularly for document metadata, permissions, and user roles. Additionally, we incorporated authentication middleware within Express to handle user login, allowing us to centralize authentication and session management.

To maintain a structured and organized development process, we strictly adhered to the Gitflow branching model, which provided a clear workflow for feature development, testing, and release. This approach included creating branches such as feature/_ for new features, develop for the integration of ongoing work, release/_ for preparing updates, and hotfix/\* for urgent fixes. Additionally, we visualized the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) using a custom Gitflow diagram in FigJam, which provides a clear overview of our development stages and branch flow, helping to keep the entire team aligned on the process.

Overall, Week 1 focused on establishing a secure, efficient, and well-structured foundation for the DMS. By leveraging a monolithic approach, we ensured that all functionality and dependencies remained centralized, simplifying development at this initial stage. This architecture will allow us to iterate rapidly, adding new features and refining existing ones as we move through future phases
